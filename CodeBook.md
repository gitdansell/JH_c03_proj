# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This project in R processes data from the following URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A description of the original data can be found here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

The original data is split between **Test** and **Train** data.

**Step 1:**
Combine the Test and Train data into one dataset.

**Step 2:**
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each record.

**Step 3:**
Descriptive 'Activity' names are applied to each record, replacing an activity_id value.

**Step 4:**
Descriptive variable names (found in the *features.txt* file in the original data) are applied, so that each column of the data has a useful name.

**Step 5:**
The data is aggregated by subject and Activity.


## Field Values  
id: Record number. Has no meaning in the original data, as the Test and Train datasets where combined.  subject: Identifies a unique test subject (ie Person) in the original study.    
Activity: Identifies the activity that the subject performed. These values come from the *activity_labels*, found in activity_labels.txt in the original data.   
  
The following fields are defined by the original data codebook, with the exception of values having *mean* their title. These values are the computed mean (average) from the data, aggregated by Subject and Activity:
