This project in R processes data from the following URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

There is one source code file (**run_analysis.R**) which:
- performs steps to load the source data
- combines and tidies the source data, as described in **CodeBook.md**.
- saves the tidy data into a .csv file called **tidy_data.csv**.
